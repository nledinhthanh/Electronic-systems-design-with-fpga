# Electronic-systems-design-with-fpga

learning about RTL, Linux sever OS, VHDL/FPGAs

`AIMS`
    
The aim of this module is to teach students the use of Linux Server Operating Systems, toolchains (e.g., Mentor Graphic) and methologies commonly used in digital and eletronic computing system design targeting Field Programmable Gate Arrays and Systems-on-Programmable-Chips (SoPCs) domains.

`INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOME`

1. Knowledge and Understanding 
- Explain a range of design methologies for the design and deployment of FPGAs in modern digital systems, including the use of simulators and Xilinx/Altera toolchains.

2. Subject-Specific - Cognitive Skills
- Investigate tools an hardware programming practices targeting FPGA-based systems.
- Apply system design, simulation and validation methods to FPGAs.
3. Subject-Specific - Practical Skills
- Use VHDL and state-of-the-art design tools for the construction of digital and electronic computing systems based on FPGAs.
4. Key Transferable Skills 
- Demonstrate an ability to write, clear and understandable RTL ( e.g. VHDL) solutions.
- Write academic reports.
